> ## Folders
> I use very few folders. I avoid folders because many of my entries belong to more than one area of thought. My system is oriented towards speed and laziness. I don’t want the overhead of having to consider where something should go.

将所有笔记放在根目录下，通过目录与标签来反向关联到相对应的笔记列表。
值得注意的是需要将这个模板的内容、文字本地化一下。

> The folders I use:

> - **Attachments** for images, audio, videos, PDFs, etc.
> - **Clippings** for articles and web pages captured with my [web clipper](https://stephango.com/obsidian-web-clipper) written by other people.
> - **Daily** for my daily notes, all named `YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
> - **References** for anything that refers to something that exists outside of my vault, e.g. books, movies, places, people, podcasts, etc.
> - **Templates** for templates. In my real personal vault the “Templates” folder is nested under “Meta” which also contains my personal style guide and other random notes about the vault.

每个文件夹有不同的作用。
> ## Structure, categories, and tags
	My notes are primarily organized using the `category` property. Categories are always links which makes it easy to get back to my top-level overviews. Some other rules I follow in my vault:
> 	- Avoid splitting content into multiple vaults.
> 	- Avoid folders for organization.
> 	- Avoid non-standard Markdown.
> 	- Always pluralize categories and tags.
> 	- Use `YYYY-MM-DD` dates everywhere.

多使用**组合（持有对象但无法控制对象）**的方式，而避免使用**继承（单一文件夹）**
